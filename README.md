## **Build your first app**

This pathway teaches you how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. You start with "Hello World" and move up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. You learn how Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Android Kotlin app, and how to make sure your apps are backward-compatible. You also learn about API levels and the Android Jetpack libraries.

### [Path 1: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path1.md)

## **Build An Interactive App**

In this pathway, you learn how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and constraint layouts. You create apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and change the visibility and color of views. This pathway also teaches you how to use data binding to eliminate inefficient calls to `findViewById()`.

### [Path 2: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path2.md)

## **Layouts**

In this pathway, you learn how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and constraint layouts. You create apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and change the visibility and color of views. This pathway also teaches you how to use data binding to eliminate inefficient calls to `findViewById()`.

### [Path 3: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path3.md)

## **Navigation**

In this pathway, you learn how to create useful navigation in an app. You create a fragment and add it to an app, then add navigation to the app using the Android Studio navigation graph. You add a navigation drawer and an options menu to your app, and you work with the app's back stack, changing the destination of the system Back button. Finally, you learn how to invoke an external activity from within the app.

### [Path 4: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path4.md)

## Activity and fragment lifecycles

In this pathway, you learn about the activity and fragment lifecycles, and you learn how to manage complex lifecycle situations. You work with a starter app that contains several bugs related to the Android lifecycle. You add logging to the app to better understand the app's lifecycle events, and you fix the bugs that the app contains and add some enhancements to the app. You also learn about Android Jetpack's lifecycle library, which can help you manage lifecycle events with code that's better organized and easier to maintain.

### [Path 5: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path5.md)

## **Architecture components**

This pathway teaches you how to use `ViewModel` and `LiveData` objects. You learn how to use `ViewModel` objects to enable data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. You convert an app's UI data into encapsulated `LiveData` and add observer methods that are notified when the value of the `LiveData` changes.

You also integrate `LiveData` and `ViewModel` with data binding so that the views in your layout communicate directly with `ViewModel` objects, without using the app's fragments to relay information. This technique simplifies your code and eliminates the need for click handlers in the UI controllers.

### [Path 6: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path6.md)

##  **Databases and RecyclerView**

**Part One - Room database and coroutines:**

This part of the pathway teaches you how to use the [`Room`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) database library. `Room` takes care of many of the chores of setting up and configuring a database, and simplifies the code for interacting with the database. You learn how to use Kotlin coroutines to move database operations away from the main thread, and you learn more about using `ViewModel` and `LiveData` with app navigation.

**Part Two - RecyclerView:**

This part of the pathway teaches you how to use a `RecyclerView` to efficiently display lists and grids of items. For complex lists and grids, you learn ways to make `RecyclerView` more efficient and your code easier to maintain and extend. You learn how to make items in a `RecyclerView` clickable. You also learn how to add more than one view holder and layout to lists and grids in a `RecyclerView`, for example, to add a header in your app.

### [Path 7: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path7.md)

## Connecting to the internet

This pathway teaches you how to use community-developed libraries to connect to a web service to retrieve and display data. You learn how to handle potential network errors and use the Glide library to load and display photos from the internet. You also build a `RecyclerView` and use it to display a grid of images.

### [Path 8: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path8.md)

## **Repository and WorkManager**

This pathway teaches you how to add a repository to abstract the data layer and provide a clean API to the rest of your Android Kotlin app. You also learn how to use `WorkManager` to schedule background tasks in an efficient and optimized way.

### [Path 9: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path9.md)

## **Designing for everyone**

This pathway teaches the basics of beautiful and accessible Android app design and guides you through building an app that finds and displays information about Google Developer Group (GDG) meetups.

### [Path 10: Documentation](https://github.com/rezaerbe/android-fundamentals/blob/master/Path10.md)
